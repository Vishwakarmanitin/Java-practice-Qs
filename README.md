# Java-Practice-Qs

## Introduction

This repository, `Java-Practice-Qs`, houses a collection of 100+ solved Java programming problems.  It serves as a personal record of my problem-solving journey and a resource for anyone interested in learning Java through practical examples. The problems cover a range of difficulty levels and topics, providing a comprehensive practice resource.

## Installation

This project doesn't require any specific installation.  The code is organized into individual files or folders for each problem.  You can simply clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/Java-Practice-Qs.git
```

Then, you can open the individual Java files using your preferred IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) and run them directly.  Make sure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## Usage

Each problem is typically contained within its own file (e.g., `Problem1.java`, `Problem2.java`, etc.).  Each file contains a complete, runnable Java program.

**Example (Illustrative):**

Let's say `Problem1.java` solves a problem related to finding the factorial of a number.  You would open `Problem1.java` in your IDE, compile it (e.g., using `javac Problem1.java`), and run it (e.g., using `java Problem1`). The output will display the solution to the problem.

```java
//Illustrative example - Problem1.java (contents will vary)
public class Problem1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 5;
        long factorial = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i) {
            factorial *= i;
        }
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + num + " = " + factorial);
    }
}
```
